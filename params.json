  "body": "A two-day workshop at the [Institute for Systems Biology](systemsbiology.org) in Seattle, Washington, for collaborators and other researchers working toward the interconnection of genomic, proteomic, and protein structure data. Our ultimate goal is to tie together four established resources:\r\n* the RCSB [Protein Data Bank](rcsb.org)\r\n* the [Kaviar](db.systemsbiology.org/kaviar) database of human genomic variation\r\n* the [PeptideAtlas](www.peptideatlas.org) proteomics data compendium\r\n* the [Trans-Proteomic Pipeline](http://tools.proteomecenter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Software:TPP) software\r\n\r\nThis workshop is funded by a [Big Data Spoke Planning Grant](tfarrah.github.io/Genome-Peptide-Structure/bdspokes-proposal.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe workshop will take place sometime during the first two weeks of January, 2017.\r\n\r\nContact Eric Deutsch, edeutsch@systemsbiology.org, if you are interested in being invited.\r\n\r\n__Tentative workshop schedule__\r\n\r\n_Day 1_\r\n\r\n_Day 2_",
