Biology	at	the	University	of	Dundee	School	of	Life	Sciences.		Before	moving	to	Dundee	in
2001	he	was	Head	of	the	Protein	Data	Bank	in	Europe	and	Research	and	Development	Team
leader	at	the	EMBL	European	Bioinformatics	Institute,	Hinxton,	Cambridge.		Prior	to	EMBLEBI
he	was	Head	of	Genome	Informatics	at	the	Wellcome	Trust	Centre	for	Human	Genetics,
University	of	Oxford,	a	position	he	held	concurrently	with	a	Royal	Society University
Research	Fellowship	in	the	Department	of	Biochemistry.</p>
<p>Geoff’s	longest	running	research	interest	is	the	study	of	the	relationship	between	a
protein’s	sequence,	its	structure	and	function	by	computational	methods.		His	work	exploits
large	publicly available	datasets	to	identify	novel	properties	and	to	develop	effective
prediction	methods.		 His	group	have	contributed	many	tools	and techniques	in	the	area	of
protein	sequence and	structure analysis	and	structure	prediction.	Two	of	the	best	known
are	the	Jalview	(www.jalview.org) multiple	alignment	visualisation	and	analysis	workbench
which	is	in	use	by	over	70,000	groups	for	research	and	teaching,	and	the	JPred
(www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred) multi-Neural	Net	protein	secondary	structure
prediction	algorithm	that	performs	predictions	on	up	to	250,000	proteins/month	for	users
worldwide.		In	addition	to	his	work	on	protein	sequence	and	structure,	Geoff	has
collaborated on	many	projects	that	probe	biological	processes	by	proteomics	and	highthroughput
sequencing.			In	particular,	he	has	a	long-running	collaboration	with	Prof	Gordon
Simpson	that	seeks	to	understand	the	control	of	mRNA	termination	and	methylation.
Geoff’s group	has deep expertise	in	RNA-seq	methods	and	has	recently	published	a	two-condition
48	replicate	RNA-seq	study	that	is	now	a	key	reference work for users of	this
technology.</p>"
