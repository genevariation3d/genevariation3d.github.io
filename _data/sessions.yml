    description: "We are mapping continuous-valued functional and clinical data from cystic fibrosis-associated CFTR variants onto CFTR homology models. Two functional assays report either the degree of CFTR misfolding or the attenuation in chloride conductance resulting from specific CFTR variants. Additionally, we consider a clinical measurement of variant-specific cystic fibrosis disease severity (sweat chloride level). The clustering of these endophenotypes on the 3D CFTR structure could help identify specific CFTR structural regions that are enriched for disease-causing variants, and to infer mechanism."
