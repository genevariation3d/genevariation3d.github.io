We're very excited - not just because of the inordinate amount of caffeine based products consumed -
but also because we are putting together a workshop that has the goal to better interconnect genomic, proteomic, and protein structure data
with the goal to improve precision medicine.

The two-day workshop will be held in February 2017 at the <a href="systemsbiology.org">Institute for Systems Biology</a> in Seattle, Washington,

 Our ultimate goal is to tie together genetic variation data with protein level information, by using the four established resources (and others, yet to be determined) as a driving force. This workshop is funded by a <a href="http://genevariation3d.org/bdspokes-proposal.pdf">Big Data Spoke Planning Grant</a> and is part of the  <a href="http://westbigdatahub.org/spoke-projects/">West Big Data Innovation Hub</a>.</p>
